# airgradient-sqlite
Minimal lightweight implementation for logging airgradient sensor readings.

Ideal for setting up server on raspberry pi.

For firmware, [C02_PM_SHT_OLED_WIFI.ino](https://github.com/airgradienthq/arduino/blob/1.4.2/examples/C02_PM_SHT_OLED_WIFI/C02_PM_SHT_OLED_WIFI.ino) was used as a starting point
